This project is a Python-based image processing application focused on butterfly images. It leverages OpenCV and other image processing libraries to perform various operations on butterfly images, including filtering, edge detection, and feature analysis.

## Features

- **Loading and displaying butterfly images**: Import images and visualize them for initial analysis.
- **Filtering and sharpening**: Apply image filters to enhance details or reduce noise.
- **Color and pattern analysis**: Analyze specific features of the butterfly image, including color distribution and pattern identification.
- **Image segmentation and edge detection**: Segment the butterfly from the background and detect edges to isolate features.

## Requirements

To run this project, youâ€™ll need the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
